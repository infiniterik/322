# Tools
We are using [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run javascript code. While nodejs has a single installer, because we may need to use multiple versions of the interpretter on our machines, we should install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) to manage multiple versions of nodejs.

We will also use (reactjs)[https://reactjs.org], which is a javascript framework for designing web apps.

There will be more tools introduced soon.
